git clone https://github.com/sau-rabh-7/medical-assistant.github.io.git
cd medical-assistant.github.io

Install dependencies:

npm install
# OR
yarn install

API Key Configuration:
This application uses a hardcoded Google Gemini API key for demonstration purposes. For production use or if you plan to share your code publicly, it is highly recommended to secure your API key using a backend proxy or serverless function.
The API key is currently located in src/services/aiService.ts.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Locally
Start the development server:

npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev

This will typically open the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080 (or another port).

Preview Production Build (Recommended for accurate local testing):
To see how the application will behave when deployed (including correct routing for GitHub Pages):

npm run build
npm run preview

The preview server will usually indicate the URL to access, which might be http://localhost:4173/medical-assistant.github.io/ or similar, respecting the base path configured for GitHub Pages.

üåê Deployment to GitHub Pages
This project is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages, specifically for a User/Organization Page repository named medical-assistant.github.io.

The vite.config.ts is set with base: '/medical-assistant.github.io/' and BrowserRouter in App.tsx uses basename="/medical-assistant.github.io/" to ensure correct asset loading and routing on GitHub Pages.

To deploy:

Ensure your vite.config.ts and App.tsx have the correct base and basename paths as mentioned above.

Build your project: npm run build

Push your gh-pages branch (containing the dist folder content) to your medical-assistant.github.io repository.

Your application should be accessible at https://medical-assistant.github.io/.
